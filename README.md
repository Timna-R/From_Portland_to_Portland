**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. I'ev made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Description of the project**

In HTML I used the division into header, main, and footer.
The main is divided into sections.
Use of images, headings, article, nav and ul.

CSS uses media queries that can display a responsive website.
Compatibility can be seen for various devices like desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile phone.
Grid and flex-box are used to arrange the elements on the page.

The Inter font is used. Import the font, and apply it in CSS code.
