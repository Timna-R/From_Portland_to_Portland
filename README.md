**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Description of the project**

In HTML I used the division into header, main, and footer.
The main is divided into sections.
Use of images, headings, article, nav and ul.

CSS uses media queries that can display a responsive website.
Compatibility can be seen for various devices like desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile phone.
Grid and flex-box are used to arrange the elements on the page.

The Inter font is used. Import the font, and apply it in CSS code.
